## requirements
### music21
For musical object representation, score rendering, analysis etc. Music21 is a very magical library. 
Setup requires configuring a musicXML renderer (I recommend MuseScore) and depends on Scipy and Matplotlib. 
Follow their instructions [here](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/installMac.html)
### midi2audio  
For optional WAV rendering using FluidSynth or another soundfont.

Setup for this package is a little involved, check their directions [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/midi2audio/0.1.1)
