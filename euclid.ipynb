    "- the number of \"on\" elements in the sequence - *pulses*\n",
    "- an optional third parameter - *rotation*\n",

    "Rotation is a little difficult to visualize when using linear sequential notation, but imagine a circular sequence like a clock where every third hour was \"on\". Expressed linearly, it would look like this:\n",

    "0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n",
